# Introduction
  
**Wenwin** is a decentralized gaming protocol that allows developers to build chance-based games on the blockchain.
> Wenwin is transforming the online gaming industry by building **decentralized and trustless games with infinite scalability**.

Wenwin's first product is the Wenwin Lottery.
Wenwin will also offer a wide range of games including other lotteries, raffles, roulette, bingo, and other instant games.
  
## Why Wenwin?
Wenwin products are completely decentralized and independent from each other, with their own token economy, referral system, and incentivization mechanism.
Wenwin utilizes immutable smart contracts that cannot be changed once deployed. This ensures that the rules and parameters of the games cannot be altered by anyone. It allows for transparency and security in keeping track of results, tickets, and automatically executing draws.
  
## The Wenwin model
Each Wenwin product is powered by **its own ecosystem**. Native tokens are sold for stablecoins via an initial sale. The stablecoins provide the initial prize pot for the games. In exchange, tokenholders  become "owners" as they benefit from revenue sharing from each future sale related to that product via staking.

> Each Wenwin game features a carefully balanced, built-in incentive and fee model - not only for Tokenholders, but also for Frontend Operators, Players, and Referrers. 

This unique token economy and incentive mechanism allows for a sustainable funding model for the platform and its games. It allows for a decentralized distribution of ownership and profits, ensuring that all participants in the ecosystem benefit from the platform's success.
