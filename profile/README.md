# Introduction
  
**Wenwin** is the world's first completely decentralized protocol, providing the infrastructure and funding for anyone to build their games. 
> Wenwin is transforming the online gaming industry by building **decentralized and trustless games with infinite scalability**.

Wenwin enables game designers with prize pot funding and infrastructure to launch new online decentralized games on the Wenwin platform. Game designers receive a 10% revenue share from all games they design and are successfully launched. 


## Why Wenwin?
Wenwin games are completely decentralized and independent from each other, with their own Prize Pots, referral system, and incentive mechanism. 

Wenwin utilizes immutable smart contracts that cannot be changed once deployed. This ensures that the rules and parameters of the games cannot be altered by anyone. It allows for transparency and security in keeping track of results, ticket sales and automatically executing draws.

Wenwin provides the infrastructure for anyone to integrate any Wenwin game into the real world (ticket counters, shops, and other physical locations) while also allowing games to be played on-chain.

  
## The Wenwin model
Each Wenwin game is powered by Wenwin infrastructure and funded by the Wenwin treasury. A portion of the ticket sale proceeds from all Wenwin games go to the Wenwin Treasury. 

> Each Wenwin game features a carefully balanced, built-in incentive and fee model for Players, Game Designers, Tokenholders, Frontend Operators, and Affiliates.  

This unique token economy and incentive mechanism provides a sustainable funding model for the Wenwin platform and its games. It allows for a decentralized distribution of game ownership and profits, ensuring that all participants in the Wenwin ecosystem benefit from the platform's success.
